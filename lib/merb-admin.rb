  # Setup the slice layout for MerbAdmin
  #
  # Use MerbAdmin.push_path and MerbAdmin.push_app_path
  # to set paths to merb-admin-level and app-level paths. Example:
  #
  # MerbAdmin.push_path(:application, MerbAdmin.root)
  # MerbAdmin.push_app_path(:application, Merb.root / 'slices' / 'merb-admin')
  # ...
  #
  # Any component path that hasn't been set will default to MerbAdmin.root
  #
  # Or just call setup_default_structure! to setup a basic Merb MVC structure.
  MerbAdmin.setup_default_structure!

  # Add dependencies for other MerbAdmin classes below. Example:
  # dependency "merb-admin/other"
